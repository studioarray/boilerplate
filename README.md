# Boilerplate
Very simple HTML gulp boilerplate for rapid prototyping.

Styles are processed with postcss, precss, autoprefixer and lost. Scripts are checked with ESLint.

```
Process files:
> gulp
```

```
Watch files and run browsersync, opens Chrome Canary by default:
> gulp watch
```

```
If you want to use bower, first run:
> bower init
```
